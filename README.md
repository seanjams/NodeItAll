# NodeItAll

[NodeItAll](https://nodeitall.herokuapp.com/#/) is a full stack web application inspired by Stack Overflow, in which users can ask and answer tech related questions or share their ideas with others in the NodeItAll community. The frontend is built on React/Redux with a Ruby on Rails backend. Anyone visiting can search the database of questions. Upon signing up, a user can ask questions, answer questions, and vote up or down other questions and answers. The question and answer forms come complete with syntax highlighting for code snippets.

### Authentication

Users are prompted with a form containing fields for Username, Email, and Password. If a user has visited before, they can log in with either their username or email in the same field. The password must be at least 8 characters, and is stored in the database as a salted/hashed digest using BCrypt. Salting prevents the database from containing the same random string as a digest, despite users potentially having the same passwords.

``` javascript
export const login = user => (
  $.ajax({
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'api/session',
    data: {user}
  })
);

```

## In the making...

#### Languages

I am working on including syntax highlighting for all common languages.

#### User Questions/Page

I plan to have a page every user can call their own, a page that hosts details about their bio, a user picture, and the questions and answers they have written or voted on.

#### Infinite Scroll

I would like to add this capability to both the questions index and detail pages.
